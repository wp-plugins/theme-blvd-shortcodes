There’s something weird going on with committing to trunk. 

Even though I’ve removed the directory “includes” from trunk, I can’t re-add it with any commit. I keep getting the error message that’s it’s under version control, when in fact, it shouldn’t exist.

I’ll try to sort this out later, as matching trunk to the current version is really just a formality.
